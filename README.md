# 🧠 Blackboard - A Theme for People Who Code in the Dark

**Blackboard** is a dark, muted VS Code theme inspired by chalk on slate - crisp electric highlights on a grounded matte foundation. Designed for clarity, comfort, and elegance during long hours of code immersion.

## ✨ Philosophy

Not just another dark theme. Blackboard is built on principles of:

- **Visual hierarchy** - Emphasis where it matters, calm where it doesn’t.
- **Tactile restraint** - Minimalist, not minimalist™.
- **Contextual cues** - Colour is used intentionally: structure, status, focus.

No retina burn. No clown parade. Just code, elegantly lit.

## 🎯 Aesthetic Features

- 🔍 Classic "chalkboard" vibe - dark matte backgrounds, soft edges.
- 🔷 Electric blue accents for focused highlights, selections, and guides.
- 🌘 Built for long sessions - understated, legible, low fatigue.
- 🎨 Covers full UI: widgets, panels, terminals, SCM, testing, debugging.
- ⚖️ Subtle contrast shifts and alpha-layered depth - not just flat colours.
